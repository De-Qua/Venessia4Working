He invited them to dinner one day his father Matthew Bascio, first general of the Capuchins, and a man of most holy life, and told him, before sitting down at the table, to have a monkey in the house good and experienced in a way that served him in all its domestic affairs. He knew immediately the father, by divine grace, which under the guise celavasi a demon, and who allowed herself to come before the monkey, who was lurking under a bed, he told her - I command from God to tell us who you are, and for what reason you joined in this house. - I am the devil or for other purposes here I am led to TRAR me that the soul of this lawyer, who for many titles I should. - Why then, being so hungry you, you have not killed him, and brought thee to hell? - Just because, before going to bed, it is always recommended to God and to the Blessed Virgin that if once he omitted the customary prayer, I, without delay, carried him from the eternal torments. - Matthew's father, heard it, hastened to command the enemy of God soon I'll go out of the house. And by opposing them that he had been given permission not partir top of there without doing some damage. - Well, his father said, do some damage, yes, but that I just want you to prescribe, and no more! Forerai starting this wall, and the hole will serve to witness the incident. - The devil obeyed, and his father, he set to dine coll'avvocato, the shooting of his past life, and in the end dell'ammonizione, picking up one end of the tablecloth, and twisting it, miraculously made it out of the blood in great abundance, saying, be to the blood of the poor whom he sucked with many unjust extortion.

Gregory, who was no longer officiated by monks but by a chaplain and other priests, who are elected by the abbots, and having spiritual care in the district.

The hospitable for Incurables was founded in 1522, by insinuation of St. Cajetan of Thiene, by Maria Malipiero and Marina Grimani, who had given shelter in a nearby house to three poor women from S. Rocco, suffering from venereal disease, then riputata incurable. From the beginning it was made of wood, and in the same year of its foundation was enlarged. In 1523, then there was erected beside a church, which is built in 1566 in most large and consecr� in 1600 under the invocation of SS. Savior. Even the hospitable probably was rebuilt in 1572. With regard to the architects, the disparities between the views, it is useful to believe that the model of the church has given Cav. Antonio Zentani, assisted by Sansovino, and that the factory was accomplished by Da Ponte, which is the main door of the hospitable, and which can be Yea, or in whole or in part, the same hospitable. This beautiful place was intended to first just sick of incurable diseases, but soon after orphans and cherubs are also accepted for educating them in Christian doctrine, nell'arti, and crafts. In effect we know that from 1531 to the Governors of the hospital called St. Jerome Miani, entrusting the care ""yes putti that of the sick,"" who went there taking with him other orphans, who had already gathered in a house near the church of S.

Threatening to fall in 1399, the M. C. awarded 200 gold ducats for rifabbricarla.

It would seem, however, that above that area there was a tenement belonging to the oldest Pesaro, since they are written to the Doge Giovanni Pesaro, born in 1590, he fell in his childhood from the palace of his family in the parish of St. Eustace. Here he sought a refuge on the last Doge Ludovico Manin after his abdication to the principality. The Pesaro, just the genealogist Barbaro came to Venice in 1225 from the city of this name in Romagna, where dicevansi Palmieri, and were exalted state. Yes many men of merit in the toga made clear in arms this family. Who has not known that Benedetto Pesaro, generalissimo of the sea, who had him beheaded on the prow of his galley istessa the infidel Carlo Contarini, conquered Cephalonia, S. Maura, and Alessio, freed from the siege of Naples Romania, and died in Corfu in 1503 after having been honorably marked the peace? They are also memorable actions of Jerome son of Benedict, James Bishop of Paphos, elected in 1501 by Pope apostolic legate and general of the papal linked to that of the Venetians, as well as Francesco archbishop of Zadar, then owner patriarch of Constantinople, and finally appointed by the Senate bishop of Brescia, who died in 1544. Nor should it be forgotten Giovanni Pesaro, made doge in 1658, a man famous for maturity of counsel, for various embassies incurred before, and have passionately harangued before the fathers lest you continue the war against the Turkish. In the code of Gradenigo, sometimes referred to with the title ""Memorable Cases Venetians, 'states that the election of the doge, was seen attached to the walls of the city the following sign: Live from the Pesaro Dear, What is it going in preson for laro, And last madness, The Bride � Dona Maria. Not knowing how, however, that the Doge Pesaro has no married woman named Mary, we may assume that the aforementioned satire is output instead thereof at the time of a Procurator of St. Marco Leonardo Pesaro, nephew of the Doge (an. 1649 which in 1648 had married Marietta Giovanni Priuli. Here then, for that addition of ispiegazione 'by the Chariot', must know that the Pesaro family was so nicknamed because it belonged that machine, made in wagon form, which carried the boats from the channel-Lizza Fusina to the lagoon, and from this to that, in 1324 it enabled once commanded of erecting a dam in chief of the same channel because the waters of the Brenta isgorgassero in the lagoon. was taken from the bank in 1561, and raised the 'wagon', building in its stead the ""Gates of Moranzan ', which were also of the jurisdiction of Pesaro, for which reason, when the same in 1613 declared themselves to public law, Pesaro received compensation. Pesaro The family rebuilt the church of St. John the Beheaded, costrusse, as well as various palaces, a magnificent altar, and sumptuous mausoleums in the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, and gave the name more streets of Venice.

Here you can see an ancient body of factories, mostly tampered with and modernized, which stretches from the ""Rio della Sensa"" to that of ""Our Lady of the Garden,"" and has embedded in walls three statues of men dressed to the east (a of which is well known by our people under the name of ""Zior Antonio Rioba"" then finishing with a palace archiacuto, having carved on the facade, the side by the aforementioned ""Rio of Our Lady of the Garden,"" a man, though it in costume Eastern Europe, who is leading a camel, as well as ancient altar. All writers believed until now that these were the remains of the ancient storehouse of the Moors, or Saracens, but it is certain that in stead that the buildings described above were lifted from the family Mastelli , the authors of which were the three brothers Rioba, Sandi and Afani, came from the Morea, and therefore grossly Mori appealed, that the statues are images of the same, and thus was born the name to the nearby streets. We read in this regard in a chronicle (Class VII, No. 27 of Marciana: ""In the years of Sig.re MCXII three brothers Greeks, Rioba, Sandi et Afani, for seditioni civil fuggitisi from the Morea, where held many giurisditioni, took refuge with large possessions in Venetia, built et the abitationi their very honorevoli below the Ponte dei Mori, so called for the figures of the three aforesaid brethren, that in the corners of the factory together with the names they are seen carved. ""And another chronicle puts it this way in the Code"" are to be seen nowadays the old abitationi the house Mastelli below St. Mary of the Garden, et especially the ruins of a palatial building, the corners of which are placed three large marble figures of men dressed in the Greek, which supporting the whole building , holding on his shoulders a burden, even like a suitcase for dimostratione perhaps the wealth they brought in Venice, in which are carved the names of the first three authors of this house, et for this reason there near the bridge, which crosses the Grand Canal of Mercy, is called the Moors. ""To then prove the veracity of the two chronicles, the second of which exchanges the"" Rio della Sensa ""with that of"" Mercy "", as in the courtyard of the palace would add that on the camel the prospectus, which can be accessed through the door located in ""Campo dei Mori"" at No. 3381, scorgesi still a ring of well adorned with a shield with a checkered bar, family coat of arms Mastelli, repeated well over a hearth of the apartments higher. This family, which was the ancient councils, in 1202 he took part in the crusade led by the doge Enrico Dandolo. Later, remained in citizenship, and appearing solely to commerce, opened in ""Cannaregio"" a warehouse of spices in the name of the ""Camel , ""in allusion perhaps the camel carved on the building. bought it by the Dominion jurisdiction over the said step of Moranzano sul Brenta, and abandoned the trade, expected to enjoy in peace the riches collected until 1620, when he went extinct in an Antonio, Gaspare's son Mastelli and Laura Turloni. Here, according to the Stork, the reason why the people of the primitive name Rioba, leading one of the statues mentioned above, added to Antonio. Nevertheless, the palace of the Camel was already past a few years later in the family Priced, having Paola, born Nicholas Mastelli, and wife of Peter Dardanians, given as a dowry to his daughter Angela, congiuntasi in marriage with Marcantonio Priced. The Gradenigo, that 'his' Notatori ""picked up things Milder happened in Venice, said that in 1757, when this building was owned by the notary Pietro Priced, were heard for several consecutive nights playing the same hour all the five bells inside the rooms. Hence there arose a lot of fear, fainting women, dug out of the blood, and went so far as to implore the blessing of the priest, and, this being worth anything, to call the school chaplain of S. Fantino (solemn exorcist hunted into exile because the alleged evil spirits. E 'likely that the body of factories built by the Mastelli also formerly belonged to the palace of Jacopo Robusti, known as Tintoretto, located on the ""Foundation of the Moors' at NA 3399, although it is known that the famous painter Francesco comperollo Schietti instrument with 8 June 1574, in acts John Fanio . In these thresholds Jacopo gave his home until May 31,1594, the day of his death. The same stable afterwards passed into the hands of his son Domenico him, and indeed it is stated that he wanted to leave it to the painters as a study of the drawings, models and reliefs of his father, but had to disgust, way change of opinion. It was later owned Octavia, sister of Dominic, and wife of Sebastiano Casser, the descendants of which owned it until today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Arsenal was founded around 1104, under the doge Ordelafo Falier, but bought the best shape, and was the first addition in 1303, or 1304, when, on the model, as it seems, of Andrea Pisano, there had constructed new sites, as well as the ""Tana"" or ""House of C�nevo,"" afterwards rebuilt in 1579 by Antonio Da Ponte. He got a second addition in 1325 ('New Arsenal'), a third in 1473 (""Brand New Arsenal '), a fourth shortly before 1539 ("" Allocation of Galeazze ""), and a fifth in 1564 ("" Channel of Galeazzo and Bath ""). Other additions followed in 1810 coll'aggregamento of the church and monastery of Celestia, then suppressed, and others in 1820 and 1828, although these very little relief. The complex of these distributions is protected by the turreted walls, forming an enclosure of about two geographical miles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The entrance of the Arsenale is closed by a gate, advanced-constructed in 1682, with eight statues surmounting the pillars, which include pagan deities, the works of F. Cabianca and G. Comino, and with four lions around of Pentelic marble, brought to Venice from Attica in 1687, to about Francesco Morosini said Peloponnesiaco. The gate, built in 1460 on the design, as it seems, of Friar Giocondo, coll'insegna of S. Mark the attic, was decorated in 1571 by the figures in high relief to the hips, and in 1578 a statue of St. Justina on top, sculpted by Country in memory of the triumph of the Curzolari. It was then converted in 1688 to almost triumphal arch, with warlike emblems and trophies, in honor of the Peloponnesian.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our Arsenal suffered various conflagrations, the most terrible of which was what happened just before the War of Cambrai, almost foreboding of evil overlying then to the Republic. Another succumbed to serious fire in 1569. Not so, says the Berlan at that time such was the prosperity of the Venetian power, which a year later by that same Arsenal came out of the fleet that destroyed the Turkish naval forces in the Gulf of Lepanto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The government of the Arsenal was entrusted to the early days, three patricians called ""Superintendents' or 'Patrons Arsenal', to which were added in 1490 by the Senate two individuals of their body, and a third in 1498, with the title ""Sopra Superintendents at Arsenal.""

Among the many vineyards, which eranvi in ??Venice, the largest of all, and before that had fructified riputavasi family Ziani. In it scorgevasi a small church, dedicated to St. Mark, because, according to vulgar tradition, this was the place where he had've been attacked by the Evangelist fair gale, and eragli appeared an angel saying: ""Pax tibi Marce evangelista meus,"" and profetizzandogli the future foundation of Venice. The vineyard, of which we speak, together with the church and a few workshops, was left by will, June 25,1253, by Marco Ziani Count of Rab, son of the Doge Pietro, the 'Friars Minor', or 'the Friars Preachers', or' Cistercians. "" They were given the preference of the Minor, who stopped stable home. Sprung up as a result the number of them, they had to expand their convent, and erected a new church on the design of Marino from Pisa, which is called S. Francesco della Vigna, leaving intact, however, that of S. Mark, who remained standing until 1810 in the garden of the Fathers. Threatening the church of S. Francesco ruin in the sixteenth century, it was decided to rifabbricarla above designed by Sansovino, and the first stone was laid on the work day on August 15, 1543. Insurgents, however, some dispareri, was for some time intermesso work, and consultossi the friar Francesco Giorgi, who released over the rifabbrica his opinion in writing, he had to comply with the Sansovino. Not even liked the design of the facade designed by this architect, and was chosen another design presented by Palladio in 1562. Allude to these contentions probably the inscriptions that appear in intercolunnii of the two wings, where one side is written: ""Do not sine Jugi inner"" and the other ""Exteriorique beautiful."" Finally accomplished the church, had consecration August 2, 1582 by Julius Superchio Bishop of Caorle. The convent was on that occasion some renovations, but, during the reign of the Napoleonic suppression of religious orders, was, like many others, reduced to barracks. And barracks continued to lend also enabled once the Minor were restored in 1836 in Venice, who went to live next to another convent, founded until the fifteenth century by Maria Benedetta Princess of Carignano, and Maria Angela Canal to the Franciscan Tertiary, monastery monks that they later expanded with the union of the palace of the Nunciature. But in 1866 these abandoned factories, and currently occupy their ancient convent, bought by the ""Commissariat of the Holy Land."" The establishment of the parish of St. Francesco della Vigna date from 1810. He then wrote his spiritual district with some districts of the then suppressed parishes of St. Giustina, S.
